        ### Problem
        Start by identifying a problem that your target audience faces. This should be specific, relatable, and something your product or service can solve.
        
        **Examples:**
        - "Struggling to find time for exercise in your busy schedule?"
        - "Is your website failing to convert visitors into customers?"
        - "Tired of complicated skincare routines that don't deliver results?"
        
        ### Agitation
        Amplify the problem by highlighting the negative consequences, pain points, and emotional impact. Make the reader feel the problem more deeply.
        
        **Examples:**
        - "Every day you put it off means another day of feeling exhausted, unhealthy, and disappointed in yourself."
        - "Those lost conversions aren't just statisticsâ€”they're real revenue walking away from your business."
        - "You've spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours on products that promised results but left you frustrated and still dealing with the same skin issues."
        
        ### Solution
        Present your product or service as the perfect solution to their problem, highlighting benefits and how it addresses their specific pain points.
        
        **Examples:**
        - "Our 15-minute workout program is designed specifically for busy professionals like you."
        - "Our conversion optimization service has helped businesses like yours increase sales by an average of 37%."
        - "Our 3-step skincare system is clinically proven to deliver visible results in just 14 days."
