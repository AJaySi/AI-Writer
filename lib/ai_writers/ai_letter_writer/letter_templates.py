Letter Templates Module

This module provides structured templates and guidance for generating
different types and subtypes of letters.
Templates are defined as a nested dictionary containing 'structure' (list of sections)
and 'guidance' (a string) for each letter type and subtype.

from typing import Dict, Any, List

# Define letter templates using a nested dictionary structure for better organization and lookup.
# The structure is {letter_type: {subtype: {template_details}}}
# 'default' subtype is used as a fallback if a specific subtype isn't found for a given type.
