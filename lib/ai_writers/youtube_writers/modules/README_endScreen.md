End Screen Generator feature for YouTube videos.

## Step 1: Understanding End Screens

YouTube end screens are the final elements shown at the end of a video that encourage viewers to take action, such as subscribing, watching another video, or visiting a website. They typically include:

1. Call-to-action elements (subscribe button, playlists, other videos)
2. Visual elements (background image, branding)
3. Text overlays (promotional messages, channel name)
4. Layout options (different templates for different purposes)

## Step 2: Required User Inputs

Based on the thumbnail generator and YouTube end screen requirements, we'll need these inputs:

1. **Basic Video Information**:
   - Video title
   - Video description
   - Target audience
   - Content type (tutorial, vlog, review, etc.)

2. **End Screen Purpose**:
   - Primary goal (drive subscriptions, promote playlist, promote next video, etc.)
   - Secondary goal (if applicable)

3. **Visual Style Preferences**:
   - Color scheme
   - Style (minimal, bold, branded, etc.)
   - Brand elements to include (logo, channel name, etc.)

4. **Content Elements**:
   - Number of elements to include (1-4)
   - Types of elements (subscribe button, playlist, video, website)
   - Text for each element

5. **Advanced Settings**:
   - Background style (solid color, gradient, image, etc.)
   - Animation preferences
   - Custom branding elements

## Step 3: Implementation Plan

Let's create a new module called `end_screen_generator.py` in the same directory as the thumbnail generator. Here's how we'll structure it:

1. **Functions**:
   - `generate_end_screen_concepts`: Generate end screen design concepts
   - `generate_end_screen_design`: Create visual end screen designs
   - `analyze_end_screen`: Provide feedback on end screen effectiveness
   - `write_yt_end_screen`: Main UI function

2. **User Interface**:
   - Tabs for different sections (Basic Info, Style & Elements, Preview)
   - Input fields for all required information
   - Preview section to show generated end screens
   - Download options for the end screen designs
