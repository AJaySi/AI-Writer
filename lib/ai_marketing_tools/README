# AI Backlinking Tool

## Overview

The `ai_backlinking.py` module, part of the [AI-Writer](https://github.com/AJaySi/AI-Writer) project, automates the process of finding and securing backlink opportunities. This AI-powered tool performs web research, scrapes websites, extracts contact information, and sends personalized outreach emails to webmasters for guest posting opportunities.

## Key Features

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Scrape websites for guest post opportunities using predefined search queries based on user input. Extract key information like email addresses, names, and submission guidelines.
- **Personalized Email Writing**: Leverage AI to create personalized emails using the scraped website information, tailored to the tone, content style, and focus of the website.
- **Email Sending Automation**: Integrate with email platforms (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) to send automated outreach emails with optional human-in-the-loop (HITL) review.
- **Lead Tracking and Management**: Track all emails sent, monitor replies, and keep track of successful backlinks. Log each lead’s status (e.g., emailed, responded, no reply) to manage future interactions.
- **Multiple Keywords/Queries**: Run the same process for a batch of keywords, automatically generating relevant search queries for each.
- **AI-Driven Follow-Up**: Schedule follow-up emails if there is no response after a specified period.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Provide users with reports on email performance metrics such as sent, opened, replied, and successful backlink placements.

## Core Workflow

1. **User Input**:
   - **Keyword Search**: The user inputs a keyword (e.g., "AI writers").
   - **Search Queries**: The app appends various search strings to this keyword to find backlinking opportunities (e.g., "AI writers + 'Write for Us'").

2. **Web Research**:
   - Use search engines or web scraping to run multiple queries.
   - Collect URLs of websites that have pages or posts related to guest post opportunities.

3. **Scrape Website Data**:
   - **Contact Information Extraction**: Scrape the website for contact details (email addresses, contact forms, etc.).
   - **Website Content Understanding**: Scrape a summary of each website’s content to personalize the email based on the site's focus.

4. **Personalized Outreach**:
   - **AI Email Composition**: Compose personalized outreach emails based on the scraped data and user input.
   - **Automated Email Sending**: Let users review and approve the personalized emails before they are sent, or allow full automation.

5. **Scaling the Search**:
   - Repeat the same scraping and outreach process for a list of relevant keywords.
   - Maintain a log of all sent emails, responses, and follow-up reminders.

6. **Tracking Responses and Follow-ups**:
   - **Automated Responses**: Respond to positive replies with predefined follow-up emails.
   - **Follow-up Reminders**: Send polite follow-up reminders at pre-set intervals if there is no reply.
