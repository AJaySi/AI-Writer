🎯 What are Meta Descriptions?
Meta descriptions are short summaries (150-160 characters) that appear under your page title in search results. They tell users what your page is about and encourage them to click.

🔍 Why They Matter:
• Improve click-through rates
• Help users understand your content
• Influence search rankings
• Provide context for search results

💡 Best Practices:
• Keep them under 160 characters
• Include target keywords naturally
• Write compelling, action-oriented text
• Make them unique for each page
• Include a call-to-action when appropriate

📝 Example:
Good: "Learn proven SEO strategies to boost your website's search rankings and drive more organic traffic."
Bad: "SEO tips and tricks for better rankings."

🎯 Pro Tip: Think of meta descriptions as your page's "elevator pitch" - you have a few seconds to convince users to visit your site!
