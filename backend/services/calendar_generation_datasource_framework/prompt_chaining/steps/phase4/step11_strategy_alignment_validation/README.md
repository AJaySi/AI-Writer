# Step 11: Strategy Alignment Validation

## üéØ Overview

Step 11 performs comprehensive strategy alignment validation and consistency checking across the entire 12-step calendar generation process. This step ensures that all previous steps remain aligned with the original strategy from Step 1 and maintains consistency throughout the generation process.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Design

Step 11 follows a modular architecture with two main components:
