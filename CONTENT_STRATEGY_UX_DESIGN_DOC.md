# Content Strategy UX Design Document

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the analysis and recommendations for improving the Content Strategy feature's user experience. The current implementation with 30+ strategic inputs, while comprehensive, creates significant usability barriers for our target audience of solopreneurs, small business owners, and startups who cannot afford expensive digital marketing teams.
