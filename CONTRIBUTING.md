### 📝 **Documentation Standards**
```python
def generate_blog_content(
    keywords: str, 
    length: int = 1000, 
    include_research: bool = True
) -> dict:
    """Generate SEO-optimized blog content using AI.
    
    Args:
        keywords: Target keywords for the blog post
        length: Desired word count for the content
        include_research: Whether to include web research
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing generated content, title, and metadata
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If keywords are empty or length is negative
    """
    # Implementation here...
```

### 🧪 **Testing**
