#### Notes from underground:

1). Focus is on writing/generating highly unique, SEO optimized blog content.
2). Models: Openai, gemini, ollama are interesting. Minstral API is also worth exploring. Cohere API is purpose made.
Focus is getting the prompts right. Shit in, shit out, irrespective of dollars and cutting edge models.
Pydantically speakng, Due to experimental nature of prompting, its getting expensive soon enough. Gemini is free for now.
3). Missing frontend: A smart backend will enable a good frontend. WIP, backend. So, frontend; coming soon.
4).Getting AI agents to 'brainstrom' blog ideas seems more pressing. CrewAI seems more straightforward than autogen.
5). Too Many APIs floating around: The implementation is using tools that dont depend on API keys and rather scrape them.
Duh, scraping wont scale, that is GPT vision based scraping will come in handy.
6). firecrawl is interesting, gpt-researcher is providing local docsqa.
7). Had to provide streamlit UI as Alwrity's audience arent comfortable with commandline.
8). Local folder RAG and Chat with your content, website is on the cards.
9). AI models are better, not sure until when 'Free' APIs will be "Free".
10). The code is always a mess, lot of changes happening.. 
11). Focus is to stop making any more AI content tools, but rather revisit & improve user experience & content quality.
12). To Err is Human & AI....
